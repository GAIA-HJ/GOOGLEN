# GOOGLEN Business Plan

## Project Overview

GOOGLEN is a business plan repository containing comprehensive templates and structured sections for developing a complete business plan. This repository serves as a centralized location for all business planning documents, financial projections, market research, and strategic planning materials.

## Repository Purpose

This is a **business planning repository**, not a code repository. It contains:
- Business plan sections and templates
- Financial models and projections
- Market research and analysis
- Strategic planning documents
- Supporting materials and appendices

## Document Guidelines

### Writing Style
- Be clear, concise, and professional
- Use data to support claims and projections
- Maintain consistent formatting across all sections
- Write for your target audience (investors, partners, stakeholders)

### Content Management
- Keep all information current and accurate
- Document all assumptions and sources
- Update financial projections regularly (at least quarterly)
- Version control all major changes

### Git Workflow
- Work on feature branches prefixed with `claude/`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Push changes to the appropriate branch before creating PRs
- Review changes before committing to ensure accuracy
