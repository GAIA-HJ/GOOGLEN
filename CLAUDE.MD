```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow consistent naming conventions throughout the codebase
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments only where logic isn't self-evident
- Prefer simple, readable solutions over clever ones

### Git Workflow
- Work on feature branches prefixed with `claude/`
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused on a single change
- Push changes to the appropriate branch before creating PRs

### Testing
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Run the full test suite before pushing

### Code Review
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Include clear descriptions of changes
- Reference related issues when applicable
